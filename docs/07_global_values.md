# Global values
Several constant-like values in Pathfinder are stored in static utility
classes. To more easily configure the library, these values can be modified.
Many of these values are related to tolerance or string formatting.

## Geometry values
Most constants in the `pathfinder2-geometry` module are stored in the
`Geometry` class, which has several public static fields that may be modified.

[Geometry class](../pathfinder2-geometry/src/main/java/me/wobblyyyy/pathfinder2/geometry/Geometry.java)

## Core values
Most constants in the `pathfinder2-core` module are stored in the
`Core` class, which has several public static fields that may be modified.
