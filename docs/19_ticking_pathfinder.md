# Ticking Pathfinder
Ticking is key to Pathfinder's operation. My Adderall just wore off, but I
need to finish typing at least something here or I know I'll forget to later,
so I do apologize for the very low-quality documentation.

## The normal `tick()` method
Placeholder text.

## `tickUntil` and its derivatives
More placeholder text.

## Ticking Pathfinder for a specific amount of time
Even more placeholder text.

Actually, just kidding!
```java
Pathfinder pathfinder = null;

// tick Pathfinder for 1,000 milliseconds (1 second)
pathfinder.tickFor(1_000);
```
