# web_advanced
Advanced rendering engine for Pathfinder written in JavaScript. This engine
functions in a very similiar manner to the `web_universal` client, but has
a couple more features that make it significantly more useful. In addition
to being more useful, this client executes more code to do the same thing,
earning it the "advanced" title.
