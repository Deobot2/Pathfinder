# Clients 
Pathfinder isn't just a lowly Java library that runs on a robot solemnly. Well,
it kind of is. But you know what I'm saying.

This directory contains a couple of clients capable of rendering information
Pathfinder exports during operation. The recording & playback feature of Pathfinder
works with these clients - recorded data can be exported into a JSON file, and that
JSON file can be passed through one of these lovely graphical clients to display
some cool information. Very awesome, right?
