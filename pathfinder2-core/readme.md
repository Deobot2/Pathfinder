# pathfinder2-core
Pathfinder's core code. This is the stuff that makes Pathfinder... well, this
is the stuff that makes Pathfinder actually do cool things. This code is
specific only to Pathfinder - unlike the geometry and kinematics portions of
the library, this code is meant to be used specifically for Pathfinder.

## Dependencies
This module depends on...
- `pathfinder2-kinematics`
- `pathfinder2-geometry`
