Geometry! My favorite. It might not be yours, but it's certainly mine. The memories I have of 9th grade geometry
class... man, those were the days, am I right? Of course I'm right, I always am.

Anyways. Pathfinder2's geometry package contains some rather extensive classes and methods for anything geometry
related. Well, not anything, actually, but just about. The core concepts of the geometry package revolve around
points and angles - see the PointXY, PointXYZ, and Angle classes to learn more. There's quite a bit of in-code
documentation you can look at if you're confused.

This package has been designed to be used outside of FIRST robotics environments, hence its separation from 
Pathfinder2's core. Because most of this code is just really simple math and trigonometry, there's not very much
extensive test documentation. You can feel free to add some if you'd like.

# To-Do
- Have loving relationships with people and acquire currency. Of course, what else?
- Oh. Probably something related to geometry.
