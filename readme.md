<h1 align="center">Description</h1>

Pathfinder2 is a continuation of the
original [Pathfinder](https://github.com/Wobblyyyy/Pathfinder)
library - an autonomous motion planning and control system designed for FIRST
Robotics environments, such as
the [FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) and
the
[FIRST Tech Challenge](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc). This library
will be actively developed until Q3 2022, and (hopefully) maintained long
afterwards.

<h2 align="center">Important Notice</h2>

This project is still in active development. You will almost certainly encounter
bugs, broken code, missing/poorly-written documentation, or any number of a host
of other issues. You're welcome (and encouraged) to use this project and help
find any issues with it, but I need to disclose that there's a decent chance
something will, at some point, go very wrong.

<h2 align="center">Documentation</h2>

Here's all of the sources of documentation I can think of right now.

- [Documentation portal](https://google.com) - (not yet available) the hub for
  documentation for this library.
- [Project tutorial](project_tutorial.md) - this is a basic tutorial that walks
  through the fundamentals of the library. This is probably the best place to
  start getting acquainted with the library.
- [General documentation](docs/docs.md) - this is a document containing a bunch
  of general documentation for the project. It's still being worked on and
  updated, but it contains a variety of information on different useful topics.
  This is probably a good place to start getting into the library.
- [Examples](pathfinder2-examples) - several example usages of the project. Each
  of the classes contained in this module will contain more specific
  documentation explaining what the example is demonstrating.
- [JavaDoc](https://google.com) - (not yet available) JavaDoc for the
  Pathfinder2 library. This is the most fine-grained documentation, and I'd
  encourage you to check this out once you're comfortable with the library.
- [Video guides](https://google.com) - (not yet available) video guides on using
  the library. Who doesn't love videos? Right? Right.

<h2 align="center">Licensing</h2>
This project uses the [GNU GPL V3](license.md). You're allowed to freely
distribute and modify the code contained in this project, so long as a copy of
