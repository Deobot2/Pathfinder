## Description
Pathfinder2 is a continuation of the original [Pathfinder](https://github.com/Wobblyyyy/Pathfinder)
library - an autonomous motion planning and control system designed for FIRST Robotics environments,
such as the [FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) and the 
[FIRST Tech Challenge](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc). Pathfinder2, colliqually denoted
as "Pathfinder," is an efficient and expansive library written in Java, making use of the Java
[JDK version 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
  
## Documentation Style
Okay. I'm gonna be real with you. Although, yes - I could type out all of the documentation for this project
exactly as I would if I was to hand in an AP Literature essay - I'm not going to. A lot of the text
available surrounding the Pathfinder project is not meant to be taken literally. There's quite a bit of
sarcasm. And quite a few terrible jokes. I'm putting this out here so we're all on the same page here.

## Quickstart
Tired of reading? Don't want to do much more if it? Well... I hate to be the one to tell you this... but that
sucks for you, now doesn't it? Pathfinder is a gigantic library, (not really gigantic, but cool words make the
library sound cooler - you know?) and, such, it has... quite the abundance of documentation.

### From Scratch
Here's what you're *probably* looking for. Two complete guides on getting started with Pathfinder.
These guides are example implementations of the contents of Pathfinder and are available in both
text and video forms.
- [Pathfinder from Scratch - FTC Programming](https://google.com)
- [Pathfinder from Scratch - FRC Programming](https://google.com)

### Text Guides 
There's a ton of documentation available for Pathfinder in a text format. Videos aren't exactly everyone's
forte, you know what I'm saying?
- [Pathfinder - JavaDoc](https://google.com)
- [Pathfinder - Documentation Portal](https://google.com)

### Video Guides 
Alright. Videos. Everyone's favorite. Or not really. Anyways. These video guides are complete tutorials that
explain some of the more advanced concepts, as well as covering full-fledged implementations of the library.

## Design Documentation
Pathfinder's design is extensively documented [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BSUX14pQgTdC7Rce1tWTELQSHRKI-J-myRml7rBbgRA/edit?usp=sharing).
For the purpose of accessibility, many of the design intentions will be reiterated here.
- Create an expansive library capable of handling all motion-related tasks for FTC and
  FRC environments. This library should be lightweight and generic enough to be used
  in both FTC and FRC environments.
- Simplify the use of advanced features such as [odometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odometry),
  [pathfinding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinding), and [autonomous navigation](https://inertialsense.com/autonomous-navigation-autonomous-robotics-101/).
  Because these features are incredibly useful in constructing advanced autonomous routines, but are
  very inaccessible to all but the most experienced programmers, Pathfinder seeks to provide an easy-to-use
  interface for working with advanced autonomous motion.
