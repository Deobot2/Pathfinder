## NOTICE
This library is still in active development. There's a lot of placeholders and a lot of missing documentation.
You will most certainly encounter one or two bugs.

<h1 align="center">Description</h1>

Pathfinder2 is a continuation of the original [Pathfinder](https://github.com/Wobblyyyy/Pathfinder)
library - an autonomous motion planning and control system designed for FIRST Robotics environments, such as
the [FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) and the
[FIRST Tech Challenge](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc). Pathfinder2, colloquially denoted as "Pathfinder,"
is an efficient and expansive library written in Java, making use of the Java
[JDK version 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

<h2 align="center">Documentation Style</h2>

Okay. I'm gonna be real with you. Although, yes - I could type out all the documentation for this project exactly as I
would if I was to hand in an AP Literature essay - I'm not going to. A lot of the text available surrounding the
Pathfinder project is not meant to be taken literally. There's quite a bit of sarcasm. And quite a few terrible jokes.
I'm putting this out here so we're all on the same page here.

If you can't understand some sarcasm present within the documentation... well, that's really unfortunate, come to think
of it. With that being said - if you really, seriously, actually can't understand something for whatever reason
(I try to make sure everything can be understood at least a little) let me know, and I'll be glad to fix up any of the
documentation.

<h2 align="center">Quickstart</h2>

Tired of reading? Don't want to do much more if it? Well... I hate to be the one to tell you this... but that sucks for
you, now, doesn't it? Pathfinder is a gigantic library, (not really gigantic, but cool words make the library sound
cooler - you know?) and, such, it has... quite the abundance of documentation.

<h3 align="center">From Scratch</h3>

Here's what you're *probably* looking for. Two complete guides on getting started with Pathfinder. These guides are
example implementations of the contents of Pathfinder and are available in both text and video forms.

- [Pathfinder from Scratch - FTC Programming](https://google.com)
- [Pathfinder from Scratch - FRC Programming](https://google.com)

<h3 align="center">Text Guides</h3>

There's a ton of documentation available for Pathfinder in a text format. Videos aren't exactly everyone's forte, you
know what I'm saying?

- [Pathfinder - JavaDoc](https://google.com)
- [Pathfinder - Documentation Portal](https://google.com)

<h3 align="center">Video Guides</h3>

Alright. Videos. Everyone's favorite. Or not really. Anyways. These video guides are complete tutorials that explain
some of the more advanced concepts, as well as covering full-fledged implementations of the library.

<h2 align="center">Design Goals</h2>

Pathfinder's design is extensively
documented [here](https://google.com). For
the purpose of accessibility, many of the design intentions will be reiterated here.

- Create an expansive library capable of handling all motion-related tasks for FTC and FRC environments. This library
  should be lightweight and generic enough to be used in both FTC and FRC environments.
- Simplify the use of advanced features such as [odometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odometry),
  [pathfinding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinding),
  and [autonomous navigation](https://inertialsense.com/autonomous-navigation-autonomous-robotics-101/). Because these
  features are incredibly useful in constructing advanced autonomous routines, but are very inaccessible to all, but the
  most experienced programmers, Pathfinder seeks to provide an easy-to-use interface for working with advanced
  autonomous motion.
