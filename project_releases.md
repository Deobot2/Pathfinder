<h1>Pathfinder2 Releases</h1>

Each of Pathfinder's releases will be released with several assets. As of September 9th, 2021,
those assets will be:
- Pathfinder2 Geometry
- Pathfinder2 Kinematics
- Pathfinder2 Core
- Pathfinder2 OdometryCore
- Pathfinder2 ALL

Generally, I'd advise you to download Pathfinder2's all-inclusive JAR. If you really care about
cutting down on size, you can download individual components. At the very least, you'll need
- Pathfinder2 Geometry
- Pathfinder2 Kinematics
- Pathfinder2 Core

Core depends on Geometry and Kinematics.
